# Phishing Website Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project applies supervised machine learning algorithms to detect
phishing websites using a real-world dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset contains features extracted from website URLs, domain
information, and HTML-based characteristics. Each website is labelled
as phishing or legitimate.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## How to Run the Project
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `phishing_ml_experiments.ipynb`
3. Run all cells from top to bottom
